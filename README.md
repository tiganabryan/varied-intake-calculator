weight loss calculator websites give you one intake option for the entirety of your weight loss journey -- this isn't healthy or realistic. your resting intake and active intake fluctuate so you have enough energy to function.

the varied intake weight loss calculator allows you to input multiple intakes for safe weight loss.

this is based on Nauval's bootstrap 5 starter (https://github.com/nauvalazhar/bootstrap-5-login-page).
